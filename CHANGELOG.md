## [3.21.0] - 2023-05-16 [NOT DEPLOYED]
- Using fs.unlink instead of fs.unlinkSync

## [3.20.2] - 2023-05-16
- Fixed skip patterns for Windows

## [3.20.1] - 2023-05-15
- Fixed glob patterns for Windows in reading a repo

## [3.20.0] - 2023-05-05
- Fixed duplicate sending of diffs in case diffs are not processed within 5s

## [3.19.2] - 2023-04-26
- Ignorning symlinks and other types. Only dealing with files in globSync
- Iterating only 1 repo in populateBuffer in one iteration
- For currently opened repo, waiting for 4 minutes and for other repos, waiting for 2 minutes to run populateBuffer
- try/catch added in populateBuffer so that it does not fail infinitely 

## [3.19.1] - 2023-04-19
- Upgraded few packages
- Skipping shadow files manually instead of using glob ignores
- Slowed down populateBuffer i.e. It now runs after 1 minute now instead of 5s

## [3.19.0] - 2023-04-19
- Upgraded node to v16.20.0
- Fixed a bug in showing _Diconnect Parent Repo_ button in left panel
- Optimized logic to checkForRename using [string-similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity)
    - Earlier logic was taking ~15s for comparing text of files of ~50KB. With "string-similarity" it is in miliseconds
- Fixed a bug in getting `PotentialMatchingFiles` for rename
    - Earlier it was checking against every file of the repo. Now it considers only those files from shadow repo that possess following properties:
        - Shadow file should not be ignorable from .syncignore
        - Actual file is not present for the shadow file
        - Relative path of shadow file should be present in config file
        - Shadow file should not be a binary file since we are going to match the text of files
        - Shadow file should not be empty
    - Also getting `PotentialMatchingFiles` only once per repo instead of once per file
- Improved logic of ignoring a path from .syncignore
    - Using common function everywhere for "[ignores](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore)" which ignores path depending on content of .syncignore
    - Improved logic to ignore DEFAULT-SKIP-DIRECTORIES wherever they are present in the project e.g. `node_modules` etc
- Taking care of data size being sent to server, shouldnâ€™t exceed 16MB
- Slowed down generateDiffForDeletedFiles() in populateBuffer as rename event takes some time and before that populateBuffer marks those files as deleted
