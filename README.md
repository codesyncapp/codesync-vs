# CodeSync

**Developer collaboration is hard.** 

[CodeSync](https://www.codesync.com) allows your team to align with changes as they happen.

It streams your code in real-time to the cloud, allowing you and your team to review and "play back" the entire history of the codebase.

* **Improve developer collaboration** without impacting their workflow. 
* **Stop team miscommunications** before they happen. 
* **Reduce throwaway code** and prevent tech debt.

CodeSync also helps solo developers!

*   **Coding Performance:** Track your performance every day. What did you actually write today?
*   **Never Lose Code Again:** All code changes are saved. "Rewind" to see all history.
*   **Social Coding:** Watch developers around the world as they code, in real time.

Simply install the plugin in your IDE and follow the steps. CodeSync supports both public and private repos. Log in to [CodeSync](https://www.codesync.com) to review your daily snapshot, any past changes, team activity, and open source streaming.
